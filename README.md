# AppStore

Questions
From my experience gamers tend be very picky when it comes to buying games

I want to know how much does price, average rating, Primary Genre affect the total ratings of an app

I will restrict the data to only consider apps using US currency, that only supports one language. However, I will consider all versions of the app

I will be looking at apps with highest total ratings and then I will look at price and possibly another feature to exame the correlation it has on average rating.
